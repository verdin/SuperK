### The Super Knapsack Communication Program.
## __This is not for use as an actual security program.__

The Super Knapsack Communication Program is designed to protect the privacy of its users’ through encryption. In order to use The SuperK encrypted communication program you must start the server with the command “python SuperK-server.py” then you must start the client with the command “SuperK-client.py [ip address of server]”. If the ip address is not specified it will default to 127.0.0.1, the loopback address. The program used port 4439. To send a message on the client or the server type in the line you wish to send and press enter. Both the client and the server can send and receive messages. When you are finished using The SuperK Communication Program type “exit” or “quit” to leave.
